## What are the pros and cons of TDD?

Pros: 

As we have to create unit tests first, it forces us to create a structured code base that is easy to maintain and/or refactor. Also, it allows us to think critically on different scenarios for both success and fail cases, creating a higher quality of code. Moreoever, it enables a better design architecture, since we naturally want to make the unit tests easy to run, and to do that, creating a more organized architecture would help. Additionally, it ensures a more stable development starting from the beginning, as the tests created can be passed along to other teammates who can run them before pushing their new code.

Cons: 

To people who are new to TDD, they might think that it takes a long time to move forward to writing the actual code and stop you from using it, especially managers who are under the pressure of tight deadlines. Also, it could be difficult to apply to legacy code and create unnecessary workload for the developers. Next, it is challenging to learn and takes time to get used to it.
